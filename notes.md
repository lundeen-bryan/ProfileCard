### Time stamps
19.08 started project with git init and files
18.56 added button that is anima
19.43 the typing function is a flop and buggy. Doesn't seem to work in chrome anymore maybe due to updates on how js is rendered. I tried to do this in vscode browser preview and via an extenion for previewing on a server. Neither works properly. Keeps typing continuously.
